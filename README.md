# Introduction
[Hack4Her](https://hack4her.org/information) is the only female-focused student hackathon in the Netherlands. The fourth annual took place over the weekend of June 13-15, 2025. Of the three possible challenges, our team took part in _Decoding Gender Bias in Hiring_, sponsored by [Randstad Digital](https://www.randstad.com/hr-services/digital/).

# The Challenge
Language matters. In IT and finance, the way jobs are written can unintentionally discourage women from applying. As part of this challenge, our team was asked to rethink how vacancies are structured, using AI tools to analyse and redesign job postings for general inclusivity.

Our team of four worked with real and synthetic vacancy data, as well as gender distribution metrics, to explore how language shapes opportunity, and designed a prototype that promotes fairer hiring practices.

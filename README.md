## Introduction
Language matters. In IT and finance, the way job advertisements are written can unintentionally discourage women from applying. This machine learning prototype was designed to detect and explain the gender-based appeal of job ads using interpretable NLP techniques. This project was built for the _Decoding Gender Bias in Hiring_ challenge in the Hack4Her 2025 hackathon, sponsored by [Randstad Digital](https://www.randstad.com/hr-services/digital/).

## Features

- TF-IDF
- Classification models
- Regression models
- Word clouds visualizing inclusive vs. exclusive language
- LIME-based local explanations for job advertisements

## Datasets

## Results
Visualizations: word cloud, LIME screenshots

## Reflections
- note: turn all of this into a blogpost and link it here?
- extent that this tool can help improve job ads for male-dominated jobs
- understanding what language is considered "male-coded" and "female-coded" and why
- our tools and techniques chosen to maximise simplicity and out-of-the-box usage
- what we would do given more time: explore what positions/companies attract more men; sentence transformers for more robustness
- challenges of our data: monolingual synthetic
  - multilingual labelled and unlabelled
  - balanced, small synthetic dataset
  - unbalanced, large dataset
